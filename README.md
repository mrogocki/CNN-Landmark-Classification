## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project!

### Project structure

The model presented is an example of a base CNN network created from scratch to resolve a multi-label classification task. In the example attached a landmark classification task is implemented. Another approach is using a pretrained resnet-backbone with a custom multi-classification head finetuned for the example task.
